		== CodeTraq ==


CodeTraq is a Java daemon application that monitors latest revisions from code repositories. Currently CodeTraq
supports Subversion and Git servers. Details of repository servers are stored in the configuration file (ctraq.xml),
which is located in the same location as CodeTraq.jar.

The central idea of this daemon is to have a thread that polls remote repository servers every x minutes (can be changed).
If a repository has a new revision, the daemon would record this new revision. Another thread would monitor the users,
if a user has not already being informed about the newest revision, it would send out a notification through the preferred
notification service.

The configuration file has the following structure:
	
	<codetraq>
		<user id=".." name=".." notificationid=".." type=".." />
		..
		..
		..
		<traq notificationid=".." password=".." type=".." />
		<traq notificationid=".." password=".." type=".." host=".." port=".." ssl=".." tls=".." />
		..
		..
		..
		<server address=".." type=".." owner=".." username=".." password=".." sname=".." />
		<server address=".." type=".." owner=".." username=".." password=".." sname=".." branch=".." />
		..
		..
		..
	</codetraq>
	
The "user" element has the following attributes:
	* id: at the moment we use 4-digit unique identifier (a number between 1000-9999) to identify each user
	* name: a "nickname" for each user
	* notificationid: the username for the user's selected messenger service or in case of type "email",
		user's email address
	* type: possible values are "gtalk" (for google talk connection type), "jabber" (for jabber.org account),
		"msn" (for MSN type account) or "email" (for email address)
		
All attributes are mandatory.

The "traq" element describes the daemon's connection(s) to each messenger service for the purpose of sending 
messages to client (subscribers). The following attributes are mandatory for a "traq" element:
	* notificationid: the username for daemon's account for a particular messenger service
	* password: the password for daemon's account for a particular messenger service. This is NOT a plaintext,
		rather it is an encrypted value. See net.mobid.codetraq.utils.PasswordProcessor class for the 
		encryption/decryption details
	* type: possible values are "gtalk" (for google talk connection type), "jabber" (for jabber.org account),
		"msn" (for MSN account) or "email" (for email account)

The following attributes are mandatory for "traq" element of the type "email":
	* host: SMTP server URL
	* port: SMTP server port for sending email messages
	* ssl: whether SMTP server should use SSL when sending emails (possible values: "true" or "false")
	* tls: whether SMTP server should use TLS when sending emails (possible values: "true" or "false")
	
The "server" element describes the remote code repository server which should be monitored. A "server" must only
have one "user" (which is its owner), while a "user" can have multiple "server" elements. The following attributes
are mandatory for a "server" element:
	* address: the remote repository URL. Subversion servers must have one of the following protocol preceeding 
		the URL, http, https, svn and svn+ssh. We do not support local repositories.
	* type: possible values are "svn" or "git"
	* owner: the id of "user" who owns this server (See explanation on "user" element above)
	* username: the username for accessing the repository server
	* password: the password for accessing the repository server. This is NOT a plaintext, rather it is an
		encrypted value. See net.mobid.codetraq.utils.PasswordProcessor class for the encryption/decryption
		details
	* sname: short name (or "nickname" if you'd rather) for the server. This value must be unique across
		all "server"s in the configuration file
		
For "server" element of the type "git", the following attribute is also mandatory:
	* branch: the branch we would like to monitor (for example: "master" to follow the HEAD branch)

LIBRARIES
---------
The following libraries are needed to build and run CodeTraq. The version of each .jar file is what was used at
the time of release:
	* commons-codec-1.4.jar (Apache Commons project)
	* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar (Apache Commons project)
	* db4o-8.0.184.15484-core-java5.jar (db4o database project)
	* httpcore-4.1.jar (Apache Commons project)
	* jml-1.0b4.jar (Java MSN Messenger library)
	* joda-time-1.6.2.jar (Joda Time project)
	* jsch-0.1.44.jar (Java Secure Channel from JCraft)
	* mail.jar (Java Mail API)
	* org.eclipse.jgit-0.11.3.jar (JGIT project)
	* smack.jar (XMPP library from Ignite Realtime)
	* smackx.jar (XMPP library from Ignite Realtime)
	* svnkit.jar (svn library from TMate)
	
All .jar files would be posted inside "lib" directory in CodeTraq's github repository.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

CodeTraq requires Java Virtual Machine version 1.6 or later. It has been tested to work under Windows 7 and
Ubuntu Linux 10.10.
